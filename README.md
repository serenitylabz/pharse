# A standard PHP project skeleton

Are you tired of copy-pasting your boilerplate PHP code whenever you need to start a new project?

This repository contains a single-line command that will automatically setup for you all the needed code to create a modern, clutter-free and test-oriented PHP package.

It will automatically install the following dependencies:

* PHPUnit 6.x: run your unit tests.
* PHP_CodeSniffer: validate your code against code convention.
* PHP CS Fixer: automatically fix your code to match the code convention.
* PHPMD: analyze your code to detect sub-optimal or overly complex code.
* PHPStan: analyze your code without running it to find bugs even before you write tests for the code. 

As well as config file for popular continuous integration tool.
 
## Create Project
